# Documenting üìù on Github with [Github Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) [<sup> 1 </sup>](#References)

This repository was created to expand my knowledge of documenting and formating project notes in Github using Github **Markdown and formating syntax**.

## Exercise 1 - Quoting code
To create codebloacks you need to use three backticks "`". Here are a list of reason why you should use codeblocks when documenting on Github
- Using codeblocks allows for quick and easy search of your code.
- It has syntax highlighting for east troubleshooting
- It allows others to copy the code when researching issues.
> Below is a simple python üêç code
``` python 
print("Hello, World!")
```
## Exercise 2 - Using links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( )
- For example, adding a link to Azure portal it will be [Azure portal] following by (https://portal.azure.com). [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

## Exercise 3 - Using images
You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses (). Note: When you want to display an image that is in your repository, use relative links instead of absolute links.
- Fror example to add the image below ! then [cloud ‚òÅÔ∏ècomputing image] followed by (https://tateeda.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2023/02/img-2-13.png.webp) <sup> 2 </sup>

## Exercise 4 - Using Emoji (optional)
You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:, a colon followed by the name of the emoji. Emoji's add more visualization to your document
- Here is a link to [Github Emoji cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
